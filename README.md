Hi Cristina,

I hope you’re doing well!

As my internship is coming to an end in December, I wanted to check in and see if there might be any opportunities to continue with your team, even in an unpaid role. I’ve really enjoyed working on Ideawars, doing some front-end work and helping out where I could, and I’d love to keep learning and contributing.

If there’s anything your team needs help with, I’d be super excited to make sure I have the right skills and be a part of it. Let me know if that’s something we could chat about!

Thanks so much,
